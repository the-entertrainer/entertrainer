# Entertrainer — blog writing

Any **new Elevate / science / curiosity blog post** must load and apply all four skills before drafting:

- `.claude/skills/naveen-curiosity-science-blog/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/say-it-like-naveen/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/human-not-model/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/imagegen/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/blog-social-hook/SKILL.md`

Order: research → draft in Naveen’s voice → **run the human-not-model gate** → craft `socialHook` (LinkedIn/OG, ≠ dek) → images. If the gate fails, rebuild from the outline. Do not synonym-swap. Do not “humanize” with typos, slang, or extra contractions.

Research the specific topic first. Do not draft from memory. Do not copy skill example titles.

## Do not publish

- Pop-neuro title templates (“Why Your Brain Is Hardwired…”, “Why Your Brain Might Be Hiding…”, “the terrifying truth”).
- Invented or mismatched citations.
- Unearned topic detours (quantum, Q-Day, “evolutionary necessity”) that the hook does not require.
- Generic explainers with no ordinary scene, no competing interpretation, and no useful landing.
- Model-default register: *delve, tapestry, underscore, intricate, pivotal, realm, landscape, it’s important to note, whether you’re a, in today’s fast-paced*, metronomic paragraph length, or a draft whose sentence-length CV is below 0.55.

House style is the hand-authored Elevate essays (moonly, jamais vu, midpoint, lie perfectly, Bloom/AI). Compose drafts stay unpublished until they match that bar **and** pass `human-not-model`.


## Social hook (required)

Every published Elevate post needs `socialHook` in `content/blogs.ts` (and composed JSON): LinkedIn/OG interruption copy, ~100–150 chars, **not** a copy of `dek`. See `docs/blog-social-hook.md` and `.claude/skills/blog-social-hook/SKILL.md`. Fail closed via `npm run check:social-hooks`. After deploy, refresh LinkedIn with Post Inspector.
