    '=== COMPOSE RULES ===',
    '- Research-first structure and claim care from the curiosity skill; voice from say-it-like-naveen; register from human-not-model.',
    '- Title must be invented for THIS topic. Never copy a skill example title. Never use “Why Your Brain Is Hardwired…”, “Why Your Brain Might Be Hiding…”, “the terrifying truth”, “dissolving into the ether”, or other pop-neuro clickbait.',
    '- Start from an ordinary, specific, filmable scene the reader has actually lived. Stay with one precise question. Do not pad with quantum / Q-Day / cosmic detours unless that is the question.',
    '- Include exactly one lead block first, then a mix of paragraphs, headings, at least one callout, 2–4 figure blocks (src empty), optionally a list and a blockquote, and end with a closing block.',
    '- One section MUST be a competing interpretation or limitation. If the evidence is mixed, say so.',
    '- Sentence rhythm must be bursty: many sentences ≤ 8 words, some long. Zero Tier-1 excess words (delve, tapestry, underscore, intricate, pivotal, realm, …). Max two “it’s not X, it’s Y.” No “in today’s fast-paced”, “it’s important to note”, “whether you’re a”.',
    '- Do not add typos, slang, or extra contractions to “sound human.” Elevate prose is often fully expanded.',
    '- Inline cite important claims in paragraph text as [1], [2], matching references[].id.',
    '- References must be real papers you can name accurately (real title, authors, venue, year, working DOI/URL). Do not invent DOIs. If unsure, omit.',
    '- minutes: realistic 6–12.',
    '- socialHook: required. ~100–150 characters. Social interruption copy for og:description — not a paraphrase of dek. Must differ from dek. Open loop the essay actually pays off. No slogan stacks.',
    '- category: exactly one of Mind, Universe, Science, Technology (MUST).',
    '- marginNote.label often "One useful idea." — body is one crisp takeaway.',
    '- Figure blocks need strong alt + caption describing what image would illustrate; leave src as "".',
    '- Do not auto-publish language; this is a draft for human polish.',
    '- When a topic could be read as harm/deception how-to, write the science of cognition / psychology / why perfect performance is a myth — never instructional harm.',
    '- Prefer scientific curiosity framing over how-to framing.',
    '- heroBrief is REQUIRED: pick ONE conceptual metaphor matching Elevate covers (cream/ink/cobalt). Examples: tangled roads from a head vs one clear cobalt path (intelligence/choice); coffee cup + concentric ripples (entropy/energy); dual profiles organic vs circuit (AI/dialogue); scales tipped unexpectedly (midpoint/trade-offs). No decorative noise, no text overlays, no logos.',
    '- Return ONLY the JSON object.'
